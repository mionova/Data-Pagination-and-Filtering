# Data Pagination and Filtering

In this project, I used a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page.

I started with provided html, css, and a data file that contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. I used my JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page. Then I added navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.

My solutions is flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths.
