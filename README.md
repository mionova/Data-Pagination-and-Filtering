# Data Pagination and Filtering

In this project, I used a common web development technique known as “pagination” to improve a web page's usability.

I started with basic HTML & CSS starter code, and a data file that contains information for 42 students – including name, email, and picture. I used my JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page. I also added pagination buttons that a user can click to display different pages of students, and a search box that allows users to filter the results.

My solution is flexible and can handle student data arrays of various lengths.
