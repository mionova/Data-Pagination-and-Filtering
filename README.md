# Data Pagination and Filtering

In this project, I used a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance a web page's usability.

I started with provided HTML, CSS, and a data file that contains information for 42 students – including name, email, and picture. I used my JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page. I also added pagination buttons that the user can click to display different pages of students and a search box that allows filtering the results.

My solution is flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths.
